# Lab 29 ~ Component Composition

**Author**: Mitchell

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This lab focuses on a continuation of the previously built notes application, located in the **[Lab 28](https://github.com/futurebound/28-routing-and-testing/tree/master/lab-mitchell)** repository. This new version incorporates a `NoteUpdateForm` `React` component that is able to update the overall `App` state on submission of new content. In the `NoteItem` component, if a user double clicks on any note's content, the application should switch to an 'Edit View'. This view shows the `NoteUpdateForm` and a `cancel` button which will exit the mode. Using `enzyme`, tests are incorporated for these components as well.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. If wanting to view tests, enter `npm install -D` into the command line. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
